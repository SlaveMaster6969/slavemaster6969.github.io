# BiB (Browser In Browser)

## What Is BiB
BiB is an unblocked browser / web proxy.

## How it Works
It opens any and all sites on https://cloud.browser-use.com's servers and displays them.

## What All Does it Unblock
Literally everything, and nothing is saved to history other than Chess vs Ai to throw off teachers.

## Why Are There Random Games
It's to throw off teachers. I made them myself—made poorly, but good enough.

## How Do I Use it
Simple: Go to https://Thatfellerbrayden.qzz.io, and in the command prompt-looking UI, type bib.

## How Long Can I Use It
Users are allowed in between 5–6 minutes per session, then you need to make a new session.

### Disclaimer!!
### We do not own any rights to cloud.browser-use.com, but they don't yet have a policy saying I can't do what I'm doing on their servers.

### We do not care if you copy the HTML code and post it yourself; the more public, the better. And I do not care that my API key is public, as this costs me nothing to make.

## Have Fun Everyone, and I hope this helps a lot of people.
